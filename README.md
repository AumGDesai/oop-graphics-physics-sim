# Physics Simulation 

This project is a physical simulation that models the behavior of different shaped objects and their collisions using **object-oriented programming (OOP)** in Python.

### üß± Features
- Simulates falling and colliding objects using OOP design
- Uses a graphical interface to visualize physics interactions
- Includes support for custom object shapes and interactive elements

### üìÅ Key Components
- `physics_objects.py`: Defines physical objects, their properties, and physics behavior
- `graphicsPlus.py`: Graphics library used to render the simulation
- `interactivedemo.py`: Demo showcasing interactive object collisions
- `extensionX.py` and `ExtensionX_video.MOV`: Additional demos and extensions
- `testCollision.py`, `testFall+block.py`: Unit tests and behavior checks

### üß™ Technologies Used
- Python
- Custom graphics module (likely `graphicsPlus.py`)
- Object-oriented design
- Basic physics modeling
